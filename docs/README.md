# River organization profile

`.github` is a [magic repository](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/customizing-your-organizations-profile#adding-a-member-only-organization-profile-readme) for GitHub which puts a README on an organization's landing page. This one provides the one for the [River organization](https://github.com/riverqueue). See [`profile/README.md`](profile/README.md).
